How to use Figma

For this mid-fi prototype, we used Figma to prototype.
The Figma page emulates the Android(360x800) screen.
The computer mouse emulates the userâ€™s finger.

Figma highlights interactable areas.
If the user clicks an area that cannot be interacted, the interactive area is displayed with a blue box.
The user can change frames or move to another page by clicking interactable areas.


How to use Puding

There is a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.
The user can move to another page easily by clicking icons in the navigation bar.

If there is an arrow at the top right of the screen, the user can go to the previous screen by clicking the arrow.

In the shop, the user can use scrolling to see more items.

Most of the alarm setting steps are hard coded.
