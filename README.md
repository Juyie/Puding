## How to use Figma<br>
For this mid-fi prototype, we used Figma to prototype.<br>
The Figma page emulates the Android(360x800) screen.<br>
The computer mouse emulates the userâ€™s finger.<br/><br/>
Figma highlights interactable areas.<br>
If the user clicks an area that cannot be interacted, the interactive area is displayed with a blue box.<br>
The user can change frames or move to another page by clicking interactable areas.<br/>

## How to use Puding<br>
We developed the Puding using an Android studio.<br/>
The Puding works fine at 850x360 resolution.<br/>
We tested the Puding by using an AVD.<br/><br/>
There is a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.<br>
The user can move to another page easily by clicking icons in the navigation bar.<br>
The first icon is 'HOME', second icon is 'WORK', third icon is 'SHOP', and fourth icon is 'USER'.<br/><br/>
In the home, the user can check the status of the puppy.<br>
There are 2 stat bars which are 'hunger' and 'joy'.<br>
If all 2 stats are green color, the puppy will be happy.<br>
On the other hand, if all 2 stats are red color, the puppy will be sad.<br/><br/>
In the work, the user can add goals or check for coding problems.<br>
In setting goals page, the user can select a time, repeating time, and problem number.<br>
In today's problems page, the user can check for coding problems.<br>
When the user clicked the problem box, he can see the confirmation page.<br/><br/>
In the shop, the user can buy items and make the puppy happy.<br>
There are 2 types in shop, food and toy.<br>
Food items can fill the hunger stat bar and toy items can fill the joy stat bar.<br>
