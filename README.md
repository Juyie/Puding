How to use Figma

For this mid-fi prototype, we used Figma to prototype.
The Figma page emulates the Android(360x800) screen.
The computer mouse emulates the userâ€™s finger.

Figma highlights interactable areas.
If the user clicks an area that cannot be interacted, the interactive area is displayed with a blue box.
The user can change frames or move to another page by clicking interactable areas.


How to use Puding

We developed the Puding using an Android studio.

The Puding works fine at 850x360 resolution.
We tested the Puding by using an AVD.

There is a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.
The user can move to another page easily by clicking icons in the navigation bar.
The first icon is 'HOME', second icon is 'WORK', third icon is 'SHOP', and fourth icon is 'USER'.

In the home, the user can check the status of the puppy.
There are 2 stat bars which are 'hunger' and 'joy'.
If all 2 stats are green color, the puppy will be happy.
On the other hand, if all 2 stats are red color, the puppy will be sad.

In the work, the user can add goals or check for coding problems.
In setting goals page, the user can select a time, repeating time, and problem number.
In today's problems page, the user can check for coding problems.
When the user clicked the problem box, he can see the confirmation page.

In the shop, the user can buy items and make the puppy happy.
There are 2 types in shop, food and toy.
Food items can fill the hunger stat bar and toy items can fill the joy stat bar.
